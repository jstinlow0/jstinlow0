ðŸ‘‹ Hello! 

  My name is Justin Lo and I am from Minnesota, living in Minneapolis. I am an Act Six Scholar attending Bethany Lutheran College majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Information Systems. I am eager to learn because I believe the best way to enjoy life is to be a life-long learner in everything that I do.  

  Though my main language is Python and I have numerious projects made in Java from my previous computer science courses while at Bethany Lutheran College. Feel free to look around and if you have any questions or sugesstions, you can reach me through my email: [jstinlow@gmail.com].
